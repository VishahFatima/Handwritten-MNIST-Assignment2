# Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to the Assignment 2 of my deep learning course completed as part of the Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science & AI at NED University of Engineering & Technology. The objective of the assignment was to create a convolutional Neural NetworkFrom Scratch for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification. 

## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** MNIST Handwritten Digits (60,000 training images and 10,000 test images)
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Tools Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Usage
Each task is implemented as a separate Python script or Jupyter Notebook. Clone the repository and explore the solutions to enhance your understanding.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Handwritten-MNIST-Assignment2.git
cd Handwritten-MNIST-Assignment2
